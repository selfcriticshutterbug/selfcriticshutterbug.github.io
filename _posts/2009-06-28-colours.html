<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-204" title="TechniColour" src="/assets/gok-344u2.jpg" alt="TechniColour" width="448" height="256" /><br />

<p style="text-align: left;">I was walking by on the old streets of the coastal tourist town of <a title="Gokarna" href="http://www.mustseeindia.com/Gokarna" target="_blank">Gokarna</a>, near the <a href="http://www.srigokarna.org/" target="_blank">famous temple</a>, when I saw this shop of colours and my attention was instantly drawn to the amazing  array of colours of different shades.<br />
What I like about this photo is obviously the different colours... In post-processing using Adobe Photoshop CS3, I cropped to remove the unnecessary edges and got a wide-angle shot. I played around with the levels to get a decent amount of contrast in the picture to bring out the colours even better. And I had to burn a few areas towards the bottom of the image to get out few washed-out details because the scorching hot sunlight had washed out some areas of my photo.<br />
I also liked the tinge of green I got while playing with the levels. It gives a different look to the photo, something reminiscent of the photos of the age of transition from black and white to colour.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Coming to the improvements in this image, I guess it would have taken the image to a higher level if I could have captured the emotions of the people a bit more closely. But, I wanted the whole range of the colors to be part of the image.<br />
A lower Exposure setting would have captured the scene even better with more information about the colours and the shadows coming out giving a different depth to the photo.</p></p>
