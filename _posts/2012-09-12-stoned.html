<p>I know what you're thinking: what's the point of this photo? I have no idea :-)</p>
<p>There was some beautification work going on at our resort in Chamkar in Bumthang valley. They were laying these stones for .. I don't know .. some kind of walkway or something. The placement and the smooth stones caught my attention and I thought I'd experiment with them.</p>
<p>As so often happens with photography - I can't quite place my finger on what I like about this photo - but I do like it! Critique welcome.</p>
