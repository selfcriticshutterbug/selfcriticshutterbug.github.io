<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="/assets/2009/02/earphones.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-116 aligncenter" title="earphones" src="/assets/earphones.jpg" alt="Maze of Earphones" width="495" height="473" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>Tv: 1/500s; Av: F/8.0; f: 6mm (35mm-equiv: 38mm); Flash used</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>Processed using GIMP2.<br />
</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was a totally experimental snap. I placed the the bunch of entangled and entwined earphones on a large white paper on the floor; and took the snap from right on top of the subject. I was experimenting with lighting conditions as has been suggested to me by many readers. I guess I still have a long way to go as far as getting the lighting and background right goes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I tried several options while editing the image. My main intention was to get a raw B&amp;W look. While I succeeded in that, I feel the image editing leaves a lot to be desired too. The intention of posting this image is to get advice from readers about how better this image could have been edited. On the lighting conditions front, I will continue experimenting till I get even the basics right.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What improvements would I like to see?</p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li>This image seems to be overly sharpened and overly contrasted - so 2 points deducted for editing</li>
<li>Light distribution is not uniform - the lower area is well composed but the top area is too cluttered - 1 minus point for photograph framing</li>
<li>Observing the lower left of the snap, one sees a white earphone wire on a white background - not at all distinguishable. I think I should tried to get the <em><strong>shadow</strong></em> of the white wire over the white paper. That would have increased the appeal several fold - 2 points down for composition.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And thats just the beginning, I am sure!</p></p>
