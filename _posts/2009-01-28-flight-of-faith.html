<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-100" title="Flight of Faith" src="/assets/othekola2.jpg" alt="Flight of Faith" width="495" height="330" /></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>Tv: 1/125 (0.008 ) s; Av: F/3.2; f: 31.3 mm (35mm-equiv: 189 mm); ISO 140</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a photo which conveys a feeling... a feeling of faith. This photo was taken in an "Othekola", a type of "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhuta_Kola">Bhuta Kola</a>", a religious ceremony in Dakshina Kannada district in Karnataka. I like the way the look in the eyes of the worshipers has come out on the photo, conveying a sense of awe, faith and a little bit of fear.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
To be frank, while taking this photo I was not concentrating much about the expressions of the people. I was looking to get the motion blur while capturing the fall towards the pile of embers. But, I discovered that adding a bit more shadows and tweaking the levels and saturation gave a whole new meaning and dynamism to the photo. I like the noise in the photo which gives it an old, grainy, spoilt look to the photo.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
However, the noise can be viewed as a drawback as well. Another drawback is that people may see it as a loss of a little naturality of the photo because of the effects in Photoshop; but I wanted a different colour tone for this picture and so was experimenting with it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
I would have been better if the subject was better focussed and the background was blurred out a little.</p></p>
