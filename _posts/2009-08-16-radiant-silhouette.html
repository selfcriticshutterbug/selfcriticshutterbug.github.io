<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-279" title="Talekad 94u2" src="/assets/Talekad-94u2.jpg" alt="Talekad 94u2" width="576" height="435" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Av: F/8; Tv: 0.001s (1/1000); f: 6mm; ISO: 80</p>
<p>This is actually an old photo I took with my friend's Sony DSC-H2 camera during a trip to the wonderful temple at <a title="Somanthpur, Karnataka" href="http://www.karnataka.com/tourism/somnathpur">Somanathpur</a>. The sky was brilliant that day with very well-defined clouds and the sun was out.<br />
As I looked up to the sky that time, I saw this brilliant ray of sunlight coming out of the clouds. I tried to capture it as a backdrop to the wonderful architecture of the temple. This photo<em> had</em> to be in Black and White because of the amazing shades of gray in the sky offering differing levels of contrast, which B &amp; W portrays so majestically.<br />
Because I was shooting directly at the sun, I preferred very minimal exposure with very short shutter speed and a low ISO.</p>
<p>To get the silhouette effect of the temple with that camera (in which I could not adjust the area of focus and the level of focus) I aimed the centre of the field to a bright area (like the sky) while keeping the click button half-pressed and then changed the camera position to aim at the temple. (This is a method to get great silhouettes with any basic camera, actually)<br />
The different levels of gray in the sky offer a great amount of dynamism. Infact, it does offer an intimidating and scary image; like that of an impending disaster  (as shown in the movies :p)</p>
<p>I could have tried to follow the Rule of Thirds here; but that would mean zooming out and I feared if the effect of the Ray of light would be dampened and lose prominence.<br />
The Lens Glare in the photo can be both a boon and a bane. I guess, in this case, it isn't so bad (position-wise). So, it does make the photo look better.</p>
