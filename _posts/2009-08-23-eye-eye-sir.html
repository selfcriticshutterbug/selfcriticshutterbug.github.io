<p style="text-align: center;">
<p>[caption id="attachment_273" align="aligncenter" width="510" caption="Bird Park, Kuala Lumpur"]<a href="/assets/2009/08/Birdie-1.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-273 " title="Birdie" src="/assets/Birdie-1.jpg" alt="Birs Park, Kuala Lumpur" width="510" height="448" /></a>[/caption]</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Av: F/3.5; Tv:1/250; f:72mm (35mm-equiv: 454mm)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I have not done much post-editing for this - save for the cropping. And of course, the minor color and lighting adjustments with GIMP2 (and frankly, I think I should have left the lighting and color untouched - it would have given the snap a more authentic feel!)</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">What I like about this photo:</p>
<ul>
<li>The subject, which looks like it is in rapt attention (this was easier than it seems - birds of this particular species stand very still; and hardly move)</li>
<li>I also like the sharpness in this photo, especially the eye and the beak.</li>
</ul>
<p>What I'd like to improve?</p>
<ul>
<li>The framing for one - Although this negative effect has been reduced a bit after cropping. What I'd prefer to do was, have something interesting in the background.</li>
<li>As a consequence of the previous point; I'd also increase the depth of field - so that the background is more visible.</li>
</ul>
