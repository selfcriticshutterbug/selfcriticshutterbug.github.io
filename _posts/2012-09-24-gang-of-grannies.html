<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Tv: 1/80s; Av: F/4.5; f: 26mm; ISO: 200</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Equipment: Nikon D3000 with standard 18-55 VR lens</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Shot in NEF; processed with RAW Therapee</em></p>
<p>We came across these three old ladies sitting and chatting by the roadside near our resort in Punakha. They had a discussion among themselves on how to pose!</p>
<p>I like the fact that all three of them have varying expressions. It adds to the natural feel of the photo.</p>
<p>The largish gap between the lady on the right and the on in the middle kind of spoils the snap though. It would have been so much better if I had got them to sit closer together!</p>
