<p>[caption id="attachment_461" align="aligncenter" width="414"]<a href="/assets/2012/08/Karma_And_Baby.jpg" target="_blank"><img class=" wp-image-461  " style="border: 1px solid black;" title="Karma_And_Baby" src="/assets/Karma_And_Baby-863x1024.jpg" alt="" width="414" height="491" /></a> Karma and her baby[/caption]</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Av: F/5.6; Tv: 1/50s; f: 30mm; ISO: 200; Flash used</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Equipment: Nikon D3000 with standard 18-55 VR lens</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Shot in NEF, processed with RAW Therapee</em></p>
<p>We met Karma when we had just gone out for a stroll near our resort in Thimpu. She was ill and carrying her baby made her tired. She stopped just where we were sitting to catch her breath.</p>
<p>A pleasant 10-minute talk later, she asked to see the camera. That's when we requested her permission to click her picture. She was only too glad. At first, I clicked on in JPEG - but she didn't like it. I seized the opportunity to quickly switch to RAW mode :-)</p>
<p>I like the expression and overall composition of this photo. Although the light was rapidly fading, I managed to get one at a not-so-slow 1/50 sec exposure with flash. The bonus is the baby's smile (which wasn't present in the first JPEG only photo).</p>
<p>Improvements? Perhaps a full length shot would have given it more character, not to mention captured the traditional costume "Kira" in more detail?</p>
