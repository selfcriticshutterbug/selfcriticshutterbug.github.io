<p style="text-align:center;"><em>Av:F/2.7; Tv: 1/20; ISO: 80;</em><em>f: 6mm (35mm-eq: 38 mm)</em></p>

<p>At first glance, I thought this was an outstanding snap (yeah-yeah .. i patted myself on the back and stuff!). But when I examined it later, I found quite a few shortcomings:</p>
<ul>
<li>As a rule of thumb, tall structures should be shot in Portrait mode. Especially the once-tallest-building-on-earth. Of course, this is not a hard-and-fast rule. However, I think that this snap would have been much better had I rotated my camera 90 deg while clicking it.</li>
<li>Even in landscape mode, it is not properly centered. I feel that symmetry is very important for these kinds of photos. Even if there was not perfect symmetry at the time of clicking the snap, I could have fixed it during post-processing (by rotating the picture a bit and inserting black background).</li>
<li>There is still an oh-so-faint camera shake (you can discern it if you see the top of the tower on the your right). I probably should have gone for faster shutter. But that would have meant higher ISO and the accompanying noise.</li>
<li>Probably giving it a Vivid Skin Tone might have enhanced the overall effect.</li>
</ul>
<p>What other problem do you see with this snap? Comments are welcome!</p>
