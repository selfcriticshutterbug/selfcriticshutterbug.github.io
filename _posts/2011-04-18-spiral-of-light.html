<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="/assets/Light-1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-416" title="Spiral of Light" src="/assets/Light-1.jpg" alt="" width="614" height="411" /></a><em>Tv: 1/100s; Av:F/29; f:26mm(35mm-equiv: 39mm)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Post-processing using Raw Therapee.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I was experimenting with taking photos of the CFL bulb in my room, at night. Obviously, it had to be a very low exposure shot. Getting the combination of shutter speed and aperture took some time though. Most photos were either horribly over exposed or extremely under exposed.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I did not crop this photo on purpose. I felt that for a change, having the subject in the centre looked good, rather than cropping it to obey the rule of thirds.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I think I might have done a better job of sharpening the photo during processing. Also, the .. impurity you see on the bulb itself kind of ruins the snap. I probably should have cleaned and dusted the bulb before attempting to photograph it :)</p>
