<p style="text-align: left;">
<p style="text-align: justify;">I took this photo at the Butterfly Park at Bannerghatta Biological park near Bangalore. I was surprised I even got this shot in the first place, since I never expected the butterfly to stay still for so long (I took quite some time adjusting the aperture, shutter-speed and most importantly, zooming in). But I'm glad this little insect did give me this pose since I loved the outcome - especially the largish eyes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;">One thing I would improve in this snap is the background. The antennae of this butterfly are not clearly visible because of the dark background. Had I managed to get some lighter color in the back instead (maybe a leafy green), the antennae would have been more prominently visible. The other shortcoming is the focus. Some areas seem out of focus. Probably manual focus might have helped - but I did not bother with that since with so much zoom, it is difficult to adjust the manual focus.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;">On this visit, I also learned the difference between a butterfly and a moth (and I used to think they're the same!!)</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li>Moths are nocturnal; butterflies are normally active during the day</li>
<li>Moths have a bulbous tip to their antennae whereas butterflies have feathery or thin ones</li>
<li>Moths spread out their wings when at rest. On the other hand, butterflies fold theirs.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So I can be pretty sure this insect that I captured is indeed a butterfly.</p>
