<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Equipment: Nikon D3000 with standard 18-55 VR Lens</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Shot in Auto mode as JPEG Normal</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Processed with RAW Therapee</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This is the view of the Himalayas from DochuLa pass which separates the Thimpu valley from Punakha valley. On a clear day, one can supposedly see about a dozen of the tallest peaks of Bhutan from here. Unfortunately, we visited in monsoon and the clouds were inevitable.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">We weren't complaining though. The clouds made for a stunning setting - not all of it can be captured by a lens. This photo was shot with the Auto setting, without RAW, and yet it stands out. What I like about this photo is the endless mountains being obscured by the clouds. The structure in the foreground (a Stupa)Â  serves to give the rest of the photo some depth.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">What could have been done better was to crop out that structure jutting in at the right end of the snap. I tried that out, but didn't like the outcome, so I retained it.</p>
