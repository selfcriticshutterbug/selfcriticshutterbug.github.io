<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-270" title="IMG_4368u2" src="/assets/IMG_4368u2.jpg" alt="IMG_4368u2" width="645" height="440" /><em>Av: F/5.6; Tv: 1/60(0.017)s; f: 55mm(35mm equivalent - 338mm); ISO: 200; Metering mode : Matrix</em></p>
<p>One would think this photo was taken in a remote village; while actually, it was taken in a fun park I visited recently. Pot making was offered as one of the attractions at that place &amp; as I was passing by the place, I just flicked my camera into the Black and White setting and took a couple of shots; one a telephoto and this one I zoomed in to focus on the work going on. I did not have to resort to too much Post Processing - just a little a minute tweak to the levels and a frame did the job.<br />
What I like about this photo -</p>
<ul>
<li> The centre pot and the pot-making process in focus; with the wheel in a motion-blur grabs the attention in a very nice way.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li> The sharpness and the cripness of the photo is another point in favour.</li>
</ul>
<p>Improvements I would like -</p>
<ul>
<li> To take the photo to another level, the photo must capture the natural pottery with the pot-maker in the frame.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li> In this photo, a clearer or plain background without the people would have been better.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li> With regards to angling, I would also like to try another shot with a flatter angle - ie. sitting at the level of the photo and taking a shot.</li>
</ul>
