<p style="text-align: left;">This photo was shot from the tiny gap in the caged window of a Safari bus at Bannerghatta National Park. There's nothing much that I want to say about the photo. I only wish I had got a tiger when he was awake - the <em>eyes</em>!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I want to question the sense of having such national parks though. What's the point of bringing animals from all over the country and putting them in a restricted place? (I admit it is better than a zoo, but it is not good enough). These animals belong in the wild and that is where they should be!</p>
