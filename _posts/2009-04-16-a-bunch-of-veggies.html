<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="/assets/2009/04/ellipse_vegetables_resized1.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-152 aligncenter" title="ellipse_vegetables_resized1" src="/assets/ellipse_vegetables_resized1.jpg" alt="Bunch of Veggies" width="472" height="324" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Av: f/3.5; Tv: 1/160; f: 50.7mm (35mm-equiv: 320mm)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I think I did a much better job of taking this picture than I did of editing it. I used GIMP2 to get the crop the elliptical portion out of it, hoping that I could save only the cropped part with transparent filling for the rest of the rectangle. Unfortunately, it did not work out that way. For</p>
<ul>
<li>I was not able to save with a transparent background. I have gone ahead and saved with a white background. But suppose we change the theme of this blog at a later date to one which has a dark background, I doubt whether this image will gel well with that theme. In a nutshell, this non-transparent background is not portable.</li>
<li>The "edges" of the ellipse are not smooth - I suppose I should have done some touch-up after doing the cropping, although I do not know for sure whether this should be done manually or GIMP2 provides any tools for this.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: left;">What I do like about this image:</p>
<ul>
<li>The color reproduction of the bright colors of the vegetables.</li>
<li>The subject itself - this is something different from what I normally click.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: left;">Could someone help me on this transparent background thing? And about the smooth edges factor?</p>
