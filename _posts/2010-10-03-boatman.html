<p>[caption id="attachment_362" align="aligncenter" width="435" caption="Boatman"]<a href="/assets/2010/10/Boatman-1.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-362 " title="Boatman" src="/assets/Boatman-1-725x1024.jpg" alt="" width="435" height="614" /></a>[/caption]</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Av: F/14.0; Tv: 1/50s; f:18mm (35mm-equiv: 27mm)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Post Processing: Raw Therapee</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<p style="text-align: justify;">This photo was clicked in the backwaters of the Sharavathi river in Karnataka's Shimoga district. The original NEF snap had a much wider angle - I cropped it to less than a third of the original.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;">During the processing of this photo, I learnt the nuances of B&amp;W processing using RAW Therapee to a greater extent. I learnt to control the tone of the B&amp;W to my liking. I also liked the "story-telling" mood of this snap.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;">Playing the critic's role, here are some ways I'd improve this snap:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li>Probably try to get the boat vertically positioned? That'd give some depth</li>
<li>I'm not happy with the exposure and detail. The clouds and background should have had differential exposure compared to the boat and the boatman. Layers?</li>
<li>Perhaps framing? I need to learn how to use framing to enhance a photograph.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">I'd try to get more of the boatman's expression. In this snap, his face is darkened and illegible!</li>
</ul>
