<p style="text-align: left;">I took this photo on a train journey. In a way, it captures the essence of the Indian Railways - It's affordability, it's connectivity and it's service rendered to all the masses.<br />
What I like about this photo is the lighting on the photo with a gentle, yet solid gradient between light and dark. Also, there is a definite sense of motion in this photo because of the motion blur (evident through the window) achieved.<br />
Another thing which pleased me was the amount of sharpness in this photo. The way the beard is in focus is a joy to watch, for me. :)</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Improvements in this photo -<br />
In the dark areas, if I could have brought out a bit more details of his outline, it would've clearly defined the subject in focus.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I would've liked to take more photos in this kind of lighting with the subject awake. It would make for some interesting photos.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">PS - In my free time, I'm trying to work a bit on a logo and signature for my photos. Here is the first version of it. Awaiting your feedbacks on it. :)</p></p></p>
