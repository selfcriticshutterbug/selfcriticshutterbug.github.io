<p style="text-align: left;">I took this snap on 1st Jan this year, which was widely touted as a real "once-in-a-blue-moon" day. This photo was taken from my terrace, with me lying flat on my back. My camera was stretched to the full 12X zoom, and yet I'm not happy with the clarity. Of course, what you see is a cropped version; but even the original was a bit fuzzy. I did some editing (sharpening and stuff), but it could've been better.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">How do you photograph the moon? Apart from zoom, how do you work the exposure and most importantly, how do you get it sharp?</p>
