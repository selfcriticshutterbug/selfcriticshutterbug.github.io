<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="/assets/mysorepalace_scsb-1024x711.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-185" title="Mysore Palace" src="/assets/mysorepalace_scsb-1024x711.jpg" alt="Mysore Palace" width="502" height="349" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Av: F/3.5; Tv: 1/25s; f:14.5mm (35mm-equiv: 92mm)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;">This is a snap of the famous Mysuru Palace complete with grand illuminations during the Dassehra festival. I had made good use of the 270 degree flippable LCD screen on the Canon Powershot S3IS to click this photo. The photo was shot from about 1 foot above my head - I with the LCD rotated at right angles to give me a preview of what I was shooting.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The snap was obviously not centered. I tried to rotate it using tools like GIMP and Picasa, but am not satisfied with the outcome.</li>
<li>Secondly, it being a night shot and with so many thousands of light sources around, the blurry effect of on the bulbs was inevitable (or was it? Would a faster shutter-speed have done the trick?)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;">What I do like about this snap is</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The grand-ness of it all.</li>
<li>I also think the symmetry is very good - for example the "balconies" in the entry arch, with the greenish glow - they appear very symmetric.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;">The surrounding double border with contrasting colors was an experiment. Although it looks decent, I think I should have rather tried to look for some "frame" instead of the border.</p>
