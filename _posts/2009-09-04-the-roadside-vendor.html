<p><img class="alignnone" title="Vendor" src="/assets/img4774u.jpg" alt="" width="549" height="800" /></p>

<p>I clicked this photo as I was walking through a busy market street in Bengaluru. The shops were just opening and the vendors were just starting to set up shop as I saw this old vendor laying out his stuff across the road from me. I clicked a couple of photos of his, across the street; throwing my camera settings to Black and White with increased Sharpness, for the effect.<br />
I did play around a little with this photo in Adobe Lightroom and used a very nice preset for the White Balance and Lens Corrections. I switched over to Photoshop for the borders.</p>
<p>What I like about this photo is obviously the whole emotion of the photo and the varied graduated shades which are on display. The extra dark areas in this photo give a lot of depth to this photo. The textures on the door behind the vendor is one of my favorites &amp; I'm glad this image has captured the different shades in the background alone.</p>
<p>Improvements I would like in this photo include a better visualization of the face and a closer look capture of the facial expressions. I should have made better use of the opportunity to try a few more shots from closer quarters.</p>
