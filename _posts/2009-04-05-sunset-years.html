<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-129 aligncenter" title="img_3267u2" src="/assets/img_3267u2.jpg" alt="img_3267u3" width="493" height="331" /> <em> </em></p>

<p>This is a photo I took on my visit to an old-age home. I just loved the way it came out as soon as I took it.</p>
<p>Highlights of the photo would be the Soft Focus with 1 person in full focus and others in varying degrees of lens blur. The expression on the face of the old man is a good catch. With the subject looking directly into the camera, it helps to relate well with viewer of the photo conveying a lot of emotions.<br />
The black and white mode of the photo adds more to the emotions and brings in a hint of classicism. The angle of the photo is also a little different than the usual ones we see. It has got a good upward inclination.</p>
<p>I did not have to resort to much post processin. However, I added the Vignette effect using Photoshop. The Vignette effect is a sort of Lens Distortion which adds the Blackish touch to the edges of the photo. I love that effect as I find that it adds a lot more emphasis to the centre of the image.<br />
I also added a thin border to just try out the framing effect.</p>
