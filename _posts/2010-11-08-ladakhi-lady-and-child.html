<p style="text-align: justify;">We met this lady with her child when we were walking towards Shanthi Stupa. She was waiting for the bus. She agreed to be photographed, with the condition that we should send her the prints later :-)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Black and White has given the photo that special touch. I do like the woman's expression and the fact that she is not "posing".</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;">However, I would have loved to get a better view of the child - especially his expression. Also, there's too much of shadow coming into play and obscuring the face of the woman. Given a second chance, I'd set that right by switching places with her.</p>
