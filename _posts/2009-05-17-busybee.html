<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="/assets/busybee.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-165 aligncenter" src="/assets/busybee.jpg" alt="Busy as a Bee" width="351" height="248" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Tv: 1/160; Av: F/3.5; f: 72mm (35mm-equiv: 454mm)</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<p style="text-align: left;">This was originally a much larger snap which I cropped and enlarged. I got another similar photo a minute or two before this one; but that photo did not have the honey bee. Which is why I decided to put up this one.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">What I like about this photograph:</p>
<ul>
<li>The colour reproduction of the flowers (although I don't like pink all that much, I must admit that these flowers were looking real good)</li>
<li>Of course, that prominently positioned bee which gives this snap its flavour.</li>
</ul>
<p>How this photo could have been improved:</p>
<ul>
<li>I think it might have made more sense to crop the photo further and eliminate that blurry blue flower visible at the top left. I did not do that because I did not want pink to be the sole colour in the snap :D</li>
<li>Maybe the snap should have adhered a little more to the Rule of Thirds - with respect to the bee. I think the bee is closer to the center of the photo than to the top third.</li>
</ul>
