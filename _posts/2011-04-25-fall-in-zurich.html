<p style="text-align: left;">This photo was shot at a riverside walk in Zurich one morning  in fall of 2009.  A bit of cropping has been done to eliminate some not-so-pleasing portion at the bottom of the snap.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I really loved the colors of fall in this picture. I also liked the geometry, the light-bulbs peeping out from amongst the shrubbery, and the overhead canopy effect.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">What I could have done better was try to process the snap to get rid of the foggy mood. Or, on second thoughts - the foggy mood does contribute to my memories of this trip - so I'd rather let it be!</p>
