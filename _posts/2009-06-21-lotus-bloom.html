<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="/assets/2009/06/LotusBloom.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-196" title="LotusBloom" src="/assets/LotusBloom.jpg" alt="LotusBloom" width="442" height="332" /></a><em>Tv:1/400s;Â  Av:F/4;</em><em> f:6mm(35mm-equiv: 38mm)</em></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">This snap was shot when I was a complete new-born at photography. I had just about managed to grasp the basics - the theory at least (the thing about letting maximum light onto the sensor - and adjusting shutter speed, aperture value &amp; ISO to achieve this).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Considering that it was one of my very initial "good" shots, I was undoubtedly thrilled at the outcome. What I do like is the overall crispiness in the photo. I especially liked the "folded-hands" effect in the center of the photograph.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Improvements?</p>
<ul>
<li>Well, composition for one - I think I should have included a slightly (maybe 10%) larger area. I think I closed in a little too much.</li>
<li>Secondly, I feel there was a bit of camera shake. It is not really visible in this resized version, but well-pronounced in the original 2272*1704 image.</li>
<li>And finally, do I see some noise, particularly in the lower right region? I guess I might have used a higher ISO.</li>
</ul>
