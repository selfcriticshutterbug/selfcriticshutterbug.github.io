<p style="text-align: justify;">I took a picture of this kid at Sarchu - which is the border between J&amp;K and Himachal Pradesh. We were exiting Ladakh and I wanted to take this photo as a sort of souvenir - a parting gift for myself.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I wanted to retain the original color photo because it highlighted the endearing child's pink cheeks (which is a feature of all children in the region). However, the B&amp;W brought out the expression better - so I decided to go B&amp;W.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I only wish I had gotten a better background - a more natural one. The tent and that other asbestos shelter (I don't know what its called) kind of spoil an otherwise great snap.</p>
