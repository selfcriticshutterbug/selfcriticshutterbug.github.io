<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="/assets/SunnyMorning.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-316" style="border: 1px solid black;" title="SunnyMorning" src="/assets/SunnyMorning.jpg" alt="SunnyMorning" width="640" height="480" /></a><em>Av: F/2.7; Tv:1/160s; f:7.2mm(35mm-equiv:46mm)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This was shot in a park in Salzburg, Austria. The sun was out but it was really cold. I liked the geometry of the scene (parallel lines of trees and the parallel shadows being cast).</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I think however that this snap could have done with some cropping to remove the irrelevant portions to the extreme left; I did try it once but then decided to stick to the original. Secondly, I reproduced the original picture here; although in hindsight I think some post-processing might have helped in beautifying it up a little.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I did try desaturating this snap and the results were good; but again, I wanted to showcase the vibrant greens of the lawn and hence decided to put up this one instead.</p>
