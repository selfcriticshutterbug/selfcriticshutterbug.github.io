<p style="text-align:center;">
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>Shooting Mode: SCN (Fireworks</em>).</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>Tv: 2s; Av: F/8.0; f: 26.8mm (35mm-equivalent: 169 mm)</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">
<p style="text-align:left;">At the outset, let me state that I view this post as a "How-<em><strong>NOT</strong></em>-to-take-a-photo" article of sorts :)</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">This was an experimental snap. The camera has a "Scenery" mode (<strong>SCN</strong> on the dial); which has supposedly optimal settings for various kinds of scenery (beach, snow, foliage, fireworks etc). I shot a few snaps of fireworks using the "Fireworks" setting in the SCN mode. And I learnt a few things:</p>
<ul>
<li>The settings (at least for fireworks) are <strong>not</strong> optimal. As you see, fully closing the aperture and keeping the shutter open for 2 seconds is not my idea of photographing bursts of fireworks.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>These settings are probably for the spectacular display which you see high in the sky - ya those expensive, expansive types which you see in fireworks shows/competitions. Come to think of it - yes - a 2 sec shutter speed probably makes sense for those kinds.</li>
<li>Or maybe closing the aperture might be for <em>videos</em> not photos? (BTW, do these settings even matter in the case of videos?)</li>
</ul>
<p>Ya I do agree that the slower shutter makes for the "spreading" effect. However, If I had to re-take this snap, I would probably use F/2.7 and a shutter speed as fast as the lighting conditions would allow me (Manual Mode of course); especially considering that I was trying to achieve the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Capture a split-second burst of the eruption.</li>
<li>Shoot <strong>hand-held</strong>.</li>
<li>Struggle to avoid the over-exposure (you'l probably appreciate this point if you see the other snaps in this "series" - over exposed to the point of blinding you if viewed full-screen!).</li>
</ul>
