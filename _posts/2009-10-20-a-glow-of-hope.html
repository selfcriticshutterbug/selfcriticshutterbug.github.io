<p style="text-align: left;">The main intention of this post was to try and capture the spirit of Diwali and the "Tamaso Ma Jyotir Gamaya" concept. I think I was somewhat successful in portraying this soul - the photo shows a gradual increase in luminosity from as one progresses from the lower right to the upper left.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">
<p style="text-align: left;">Of course, there are several things I'd want to keep in mind the next time I attempt such a shot:</p>
<ul>
<li>The flame itself is very fuzzy. I think even a faster shutter speed would not have been able to sharpen the flame. I should have taken proper care while setting the diya itself.</li>
<li>You observe the lower left side of the lamp itself is much sharper and in better focus then the upper right. This is because I used Super-Macro mode and Manual Focus. I did consider setting this right by increasing the DOF. But that would have meant closing the aperture. I decided against this because I wanted to capture this one with the lights off - and that wouldn't allow me the luxury of a narrow aperture opening.</li>
<li>Maybe I should've tried this on table-top instead of the floor? Or does the floor design pattern add some variety to this snap? Well - I can't decide!</li>
</ul></p>
