<p style="text-align:left;">This picture was shot at my native village where coffee cherries were being dried prior to extracting the coffee bean. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Processing_of_coffee" target="_blank">Here</a> are more details of coffee processing.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Some of the things I like about this photo:</p>
<ul>
<li>This snap is an example of how the rule-of-thirds could be used to create a visually pleasing effect. This snap might not have been as pleasing had the coffee cherry been smack in the center of the snap!</li>
<li>I liked the shadow effect to some extent.</li>
<li>The depth-of-field is just right. The subject itself, and the area immediately surrounding it; is in focus. There is that gradual loss of focus as you move away from the main subject.</li>
</ul>
<p>Having said that, here are some flip-sides of this snap:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Camera-shake</span> - Even though I was shooting at 1/400s, and I was making good use of the "flip-and-rotate"-able LCD screen on my camera; I was still not able to fully eliminate the camera shake. My unbalanced posture, and the camera position (with the lens just inches from the ground) dint help either. However, I think I could have gotten the perfect still hand, had I tried a bit more.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Shadow angle </span>- yes; the same shadow effect which I liked is also a negative for this snap. If you notice, some part of the cherry is under its own shadow! I somehow feel if I had shot this thing from the other side, I would have got the shadow effect; minus the darkening of the subject itself.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Size reference</span> - It would have been nice if I had placed some other object unobtrusively in the picture (perhaps a flower), to give viewers an idea of the size of the subject. There are people who thought this thing was a dried coconut!</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:left;">Readers' comments are welcome as always!</p></p>
