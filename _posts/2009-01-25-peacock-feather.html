<p style="text-align:left;">This snap was shot at the annual Lalbagh Flower show at Lalbagh, Bangalore. Post-processing using GIMP2.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Comments about this photo:</p>
<ul>
<li>I was satisfied with this photo overall - even though the crowd at the show ensured I had very little time for adjustments!</li>
<li>Decent picture quality, focus, light settings.</li>
<li>The picture composition (framing) could have been better - for example, you see another feather intruding in the lower right area of the picture.</li>
<li>I think the real improvement needs to be in creativity - I need to be more creative while clicking snaps like these. But before that, I think I should reach a certain level in plain-ol'-snaps. Only then should I take the next step and foray into creative composition.</li>
<li>I am learning photo editing with GIMP2. Still need to properly understand the "Layers" concept. But I am already seeing a marked difference between photo-editing with Picasa/IrfanView and GIMP.</li>
</ul>
