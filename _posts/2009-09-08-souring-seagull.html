  _aioseop_description: This photo was taken in Scotland, while on a cruise hunting
    for the Loch Ness Monster. The cruise boat had lots of bread crumbs to attract
    these birds. Using that as a bait, I lured this seagull towards the boat and took
    a lot of snaps. This was the result of that exercise.

<p style="text-align: left;">I cropped the image to bring the bird in focus. How I wish I had a telephoto lens. (Any well wishers out there, now you know what to give me for my birthday!) That would have given a crisp image. I then adjusted levels in Photoshop, added a Lightroom preset to make it more gloomy and added the borders.</p>
