<p><em><strong></strong></em>Ok .. given the chance to re-take this snap, I would</p>
<ul>
<li>Use a faster shutter-speed (for gods sake, with that kind of zoom - I ought to have done that)</li>
<li>As a consequence of point 1, open up the aperture to F/2.7 (what kind of idiot takes a split second snap with so much zoom without fully opening up the aperture?)</li>
<li>I honestly have no idea why I used that "cloudy" white balance setting. I'd set it to default.</li>
<li>This snap obeys the rule-of-thirds; only - the subject is in the wrong third of the photo! Given a second chance, I'd shift my ancestor to the right side of the frame.</li>
<li>I'd probably want to fine tune the depth-of-field .. but given the very short time within which I'd have to click the snap - probably i'd keep the DOF as least priority.</li>
</ul>
