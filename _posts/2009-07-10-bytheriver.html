This was taken near the river bed in Edinburgh, Scotland.Scotland during summers is a feast to the eyes. One gets to experience bright sunny days and green all around. I tried to capture that mood in this picture. I photoshopped it a bit to make the sky less bright to give the picture more depth.</p>
<p>Areas for improvement:<br />
Framing - A lot seems to be happening in the photograph which confuses the reader making it less attractive.</p>
<p>Higher ISO - To capture more details.</p>
<p>Anything else, I could have done better?</p>
<p>PS: This is my first post in this blog and with your encouragement will keep posting more :)</p>
