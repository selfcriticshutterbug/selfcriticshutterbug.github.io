<p>This is the watch tower at Trongsa. Most watch towers are situated a few hills above the Dzongs. This one has been converted into a museum now. The exhibits there are really interesting.</p>
<p>I've always wanted to photograph watch towers, light houses and the like. This was an opportunity for me to give it a shot.</p>
<p>I wish the "slant" wasn't there in this photo. I mean, it would have been a lot better had it been straighter.</p>
<p>What makes the snap look good is the clear blue sky in the background. Also, I have used some shadow settings during processing to make the under side of the roof clearly visible (as opposed to being in the shadows). That gives it a different feel.</p>
