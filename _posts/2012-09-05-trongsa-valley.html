<p>This is the view of the valley deep down from our hotel balcony in Trongsa. One of the larger hydro-power projects of Bhutan is under way in this valley. Did you know that 49% of Bhutan's income comes from exporting Hydro electricity?</p>
<p>The photo doesn't do justice to the actual view that greeted us as we stepped in to the balcony. There were layer upon layer of mountains fading away into the distance. There were also a few clouds that caused sharp rays to pierce through and hit the Dzong just below out hotel (not seen in the photo).</p>
<p>I could have done a better job of adjusting the exposure though!</p>
