<p>[caption id="attachment_456" align="aligncenter" width="458"]<a href="/assets/2012/08/ChimiLhakhang.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-456  " style="border: 1px solid black;" title="ChimiLhakhang" src="/assets/ChimiLhakhang-935x1024.jpg" alt="" width="458" height="502" /></a> At Chimi Lhakhang[/caption]</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Av: F/5.0; Tv:1/100s; f: 35mm; ISO: 200<br />
</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Equipment: Nikon D3000 with 35mm block lens</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Clicked in NEF format and processed with RAW Therapee</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Chimi Lhakhang is a monastery in Punakha valley in Bhutan. It is said to be blessed by the "Divine Madman" Drukpa Kinley. The monastery is crowded with pilgrims, and women seeking blessings to conceive.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">There were three senior people who had just finished rotating a big Tibetan prayer wheel; and with their permission, I clicked this photo. I had already attached the block lens, so for a change I wasn't caught unaware, changing lenses and letting the moment pass!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Unfortunately, I had to crop out the other two people from this pic - since one of them was holding up a large chilly, which ended up obscuring the face of the other person. This turned out a blessing in disguise though, since I loved the final outcome. The photo concentrates on this one lady, and her expression and mood is the high point.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">There's not much I can fault with this snap. The advantage of using the block lens clearly shows!</p>
