<p style="text-align: justify;">This year's visit to AreoIndia show in Bangalore was exciting for me in more ways than one. The point relevant to this post is that it gave me the opportunity to test out my new Nikon 55-200 VR zoom lens. I was disappointed that in spite of clicking more than 300 photos, I did not get one single impressive snap! I decided to put up a few of the photos in any case, just to ponder over what could have been.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One: I felt that at full zoom, this lens is far steadier compared to the one I have been used to (Canon Powershot S3IS). Now I know why people are ready to pay through their noses for DSLR lenses!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Two: Although Auto Focus results in far crisper photos in DSLRs, as expected this mode is not in the least suitable for an aero show situation. But then, manual focus isn't much easier either. The primary reason for me not getting great snaps is not choosing the right focus mode according to the situation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Having said that, I did like the Tri-color smoke in this snap. I also liked the composition and the formation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So, any tips on how you used your DSLR to get good shots of distant, fast-moving objects?</p>
