<p>I am a fan of black and white photography because I feel it brings out a lot more depth and meaning to the photo when compared to a similarly-shot coloured one. That was exemplified in this photo, in fact. I originally shot it in colour mode, but as soon as I tried it in B &amp; W in Photoshop, my mind was set on using B &amp; W for this snap.</p>
<p>Coming to the process of taking this snap :</p>
<p>I started this photo shoot with the idea of taking a snap of a busy traffic light from a high altitude with the trail-of-lights effect. So, I used a tripod and that gave me the liberty to bump up the shutter speed to as high as 5 seconds which resulted in the beautiful trail of headlights showing a bustling and dynamic look to the traffic.</p>
<p>I achieved the stars-around-the-light effect by the least possible F-value (or Aperture value) with my Kodak DX 7590 which is F/8.</p>
<p>Next the fine tunings with Adobe Photoshop CS3 â€“ Along with conversion to B &amp; W, I also worked around with the levels to adjust contrast &amp; brightness to achieve pitch black in the dark areas and thus highlighting the lights. I cropped off the sides to position the photo better and avoid the mess of the numerous banners.</p>
<p>Some of the things I would love to improve in this snap :</p>
<p>The lighting from the lamp post should have been better defined, with a star-effect around it as well.</p>
