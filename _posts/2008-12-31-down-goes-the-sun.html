<p style="text-align:center;">
<p style="text-align:justify;">I love taking sunset snaps - no particular reason - I just like the colors that are formed during sunset. As a result, you might see a lot of sunset snaps in this blog going forward :)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some comments about this particular snap:</p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li>Whenever I see this snap, I wonder whether I was a minute too late in clicking it. Whether I would have got more colors had I taken the photo slightly earlier. But on second thoughts; it probably would have been difficult to avoid overexposure in that case</li>
<li>I liked the effect of the clouds just above the sun. I can only imagine how it would have looked had the "line" of cloud appeared right over the sun!</li>
<li>I tried to process this photo to remove the "numbness" immediately surrounding the sun. It however had undesirable side effects - so stuck to the original pic.</li>
<li>I do not have a UV filter on my lens. I have read contradicting reports about the <strong>potential damage to the sensor if the sun is photographed directly</strong> like this. What are your experiences regarding this?</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">By the way, I also have a couple of snaps of the reflection of the sunset in the river (which brings water into the picture - a perfect ingredient for good sunset photos!). Will reserve that for a later post.</p>
