<p style="text-align: left;">This was shot at Thiksay monastery in Ladakh. I had seen people get some pretty amazing shots of the burning incense, and figured I'd have a shot at it. I'm not exactly pleased with the outcome!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I think better positioning could have helped improve this snap. The incense itself (the part the burns) is okay, but the bowl is in its own shadow. Secondly, the background in the left portion of the photo is dark and that kind of masks the "spoon" jutting out of the bowl.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">What I am most interested in knowing is - how do people capture the smoke in such cases? I mean, I know the theory - but how close do you get to the burning object?</p>
