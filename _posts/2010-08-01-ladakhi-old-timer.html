<p style="text-align: left;">--&gt; I shot this photo during my recent trip to Ladakh, on the way from Leh to Nubra Valley. There was a traffic jam just a half hour out of Leh, since The Dalai Lama was visiting the Nubra valley that day. People had got out of their cars and buses and were climbing up the hills to try to find out why the delay. It was early in the morning maybe around 8:30 a.m, but the sun was bright already (the sun rises well before 5:30 here during this time of the year). That explains the exposure compensation that I had to make during processing.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">
<p style="text-align: left;">--&gt; What I liked about this picture is the expression of the lady. I think the sepia tone accentuates this expression. The snap was shot in full colour and later turned into monochrome during RAW processing.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">
<p style="text-align: left;">--&gt; What I did not like about this picutre is the focus. This is all the more visible if you look at the lady's eyes, which are .. well .. blurred. Ditto with the string of beads she is wearing.</p>
