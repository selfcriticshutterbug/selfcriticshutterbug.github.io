<em>Av: F/6.3; Tv: 0.067(1/15)s; f: 18mm (35mm-equiv:35 mm); ISO: 800</em></p>
<p>This photo was taken during a function in my native place. It is called "<a title="Bhootha Kola at Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhuta_Kola" target="_blank">Bhootha Kola</a>". It was a very pleasing result for me to see the result of the photoshoot for the following reasons -</p>
<ul>
<li> Among the things I was trying to achieve during the photoshoot that night, was to catch the rotation of the subject as a blur; that, with the waist accessory flying around defining a circle gives this photo a very dynamic as well as circular motion effect.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li> The capture of the flying embers in mid-air from the fire stick was very pleasing.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li> The vibrancy of the different colours catches the eye. To get the natural colours in the low lighting conditions, I had to refrain from using the flash. To avoid the image-shake while clicking, I resorted to a high ISO.</li>
</ul>
<p>Coming to the improvement in this photo -</p>
<ul>
<li> I would've liked the face and body of the subject to be defined a little more clearly. But using a long exposure to get the motion blur, this is an expected and accepted side effect.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li> The area around the fire stick has a very high exposure and stands out glaringly. A slightly lesser exposure would've helped avoid it. However, the vibrancy and the brightness of the rest of the photo would've been dulled out by this. So, i guess, this is the compromise I had to resort to.</li>
</ul>
