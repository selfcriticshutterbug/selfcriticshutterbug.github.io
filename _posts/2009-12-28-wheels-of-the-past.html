<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="/assets/wheel-of-the-past.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-326" title="wheels of the past" src="/assets/wheel-of-the-past.jpg" alt="" width="717" height="538" /></a><em>Av: F/2.7; Tv:1/100s; f:6mm(35mm-equiv: 38mm)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This photograph was shot at Rheinfalls, an hour north of Zurich in Switzerland. This wheel was probably used in pre-industrial era to fetch water from a well or river.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I liked the mood of this one; and also the angle, the framing and the background. The white board in the top-left corner does seem out of place but it was a great spot to put my signature!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I shot this snap in Sepia. The reason I put up this snap on the blog is to get feedback or any pointers on <strong>when to use Sepia and when not to.</strong> Almost any snap that I take in Sepia; it always looks better when I desturate it and turn in into B&amp;W. It was no different with this one - I post-processed the photo and made it B&amp;W - and that looked better than the one you are seeing here.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Any links to Sepia-flavored snaps which you have taken are greatly appreciated!</p>
